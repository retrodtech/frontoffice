The processing will take between 2-4 weeks until the whole amount shows back on your credit card statement. Reasons for this are the billing cycle of your credit card company and processing time of the bank. The refund amount depends on numerous factors such as the hotel's cancellation policy, time of cancellation and processing fees. For more details see cancellation policy above.</p>

    <p>In case a reservation that you make is not confirmed, we will not charge you anything on your credit card and release the whole amount that was held on it immediately.
